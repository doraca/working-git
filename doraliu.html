	     <p>About May Lee!</p>
	     <p>May Lee is a pretty Korean lady who described herself is a useful bridge. It's all because May found herself very good at people skills and she loves to meet people. She was always the birdge in the office for helping all the colleauges to communicate well. She used to be a web designer in Korea for two years but she found she was not too interested in coding. Therefore, May found her way to Centennial College for the Interactive Media Management program and hope this more customer service related program would give her another option in the digital designer field. May is happy that her web design experiences can also be applied for this program. Now, she is learning more multimedia skills in the Development Tools class that she thinks will help her more equipped for her future career.
	     May's major in university was Jouranlism, Advertising and Communications. That will also a solid support for her multimedia career seeking!</p>
